        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Master’s student in Advanced Software Engineering at the University
            of Leicester, with a strong interest in building reliable, well-structured
            software systems. My focus is on understanding core engineering principles
            such as modular design, logical problem decomposition, and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy working across software domains, from frontend development using
            HTML and CSS to backend and scripting tasks using Python. I am particularly
            interested in roles where software intersects with engineering systems
            and real-world problem solving.
